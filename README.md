# Automata-Architect
A game/simulator of cellular automata.

This game is written in Processing, which basically Java, so you'll need to have Processing installed to run this.

Here's the link: [Processing](https://processing.org/download)


To run this simply open CellularAuto.pde in Processing, then click on the play button or go to Sketch->Present if your screen is not big enough to fit the 1900x1068 program window. Both CellularAuto.pde and Cell.pde must remain the CellularAuto folder to run properly.

Happy Trails!
